                        "text": "<i>Last Words from Montmartre</i> (French: <i>Dernières Lettres de Montmartre</i>) is a novel by Taiwanese author Qiu Miao-Jin, written between mid-March and June 1995. Qiu died by suicide at the end of that same June, making this her final work. The book was published by Unitas Publishing in 1996.<br><br><i>Last Words from Montmartre</i> was written during Qiu Miao-Jin's time in Paris, where she was enrolled in a graduate program in psychology. The book comprises twenty letters — or twenty-one, as the seventeenth appears twice — bookended by two \"witness\" pieces at the opening and close. Written in the form of letters and diary entries, the text weaves together personal memories, reflections on works of art, and fragments of daily life. In a note on the flyleaf, Qiu indicates that the letters bear no direct relation to one another and should be understood as a series of personal notes. <br><br>The letters in the book are written by the protagonist Zoe to her lover Xu — a collection of one-sided correspondence and diary entries. When the first edition appeared in 1995, scholar Liu Liangya observed that the single-perspective epistolary form and fractured chronology lay bare the dynamics of gender and power at work within the lesbian relationship — its manipulations and imbalances. The 2006 reprint added two letters written in reply by Xu, giving the exchange a new dimension. Read alongside The Diaries of Qiu Miaojin 1989–1991 and The Diaries of Qiu Miaojin 1991–1995, published in 2007, readers can trace the real-life prototypes behind the characters and episodes in Qiu's fiction, drawing comparisons and correspondences between life and work. Zhu Fangling's essay \"An Aesthetics of Survival in the Face of Death: Eros, Writing, and Last Words from Montmartre\" examines how Qiu Miaojin, through her unflinching excavation of lesbian desire and feeling, forged and fulfilled her identity as both an artist and the architect of her own life's aesthetic.",

                        "text": "<i>White Snake</i> is a novella by Yan Ge-Ling, a Chinese author based in the United States. Through three distinct versions, each told from a different angle, it recounts an extraordinary emotional story between two women during the Cultural Revolution. Xu Qunshan, presenting as male, uses a certain kind of power to seduce Sun Likun, a dancer already caught in desperate circumstances. When Xu's true identity is eventually exposed, Sun Likun loses her grip on sanity; Xu, restored to her female self, remains by Sun's side in the hospital — completing a passage from what had appeared to be heterosexual love into something else entirely. For this reason, White Snake has long been read as a work of lesbian fiction. And yet to confine it to that category would be to miss something. The love story it tells is one with fissures running through it. Yan Geling herself has said: \"I never felt this was an abnormal relationship. There are many things in life that should not be named — including feelings. The labels of homosexual and heterosexual are deeply unhelpful.\"<br><br>Taken as a whole, White Snake traces Sun Likun — once a woman of great beauty — through a cycle of consciousness: awareness, erasure, reawakening, awareness again, and finally a settling into ordinariness. The girl in the detention center and Xu Qunshan each play their part in this cycle, and once their roles are fulfilled, both are compelled to withdraw from Sun Likun's life. Each woman is ultimately returned to the track society has laid out for her, and begins, with quiet resignation, a new life within its limits. As the central figure in Sun Likun's world, Xu Qunshan enacts the full arc from defiance of social and emotional norms to final capitulation. The love story White Snake tells is, at its core, a story about the struggle between the human longing for freedom and the coercive force of social convention.<br><br>\"Green Snake proposes to White Snake, and the two agree to settle it in a duel. If Green Snake wins, he will marry White Snake; if White Snake wins, Green Snake will become a woman and serve White Snake for the rest of her life. Green Snake loses. The stage goes dark, and when the lights rise again, Green Snake has become a woman. And as a woman — how devoted she is, how brave, how tender and attentive to White Snake. But what if she hadn't been transformed?... Then that fool Xu Xian would have had no part to play at all. I can't stand Xu Xian. Without him, White Snake would never have suffered so much. Without that wretched Xu Xian, White Snake and Green Snake would surely have lived beautifully together.\"<br><br>On the surface, Xu Xian represents the centrality of male authority. But at a deeper level, he represents social convention itself. The defeat of Green Snake — or of Shanshan — lies in her attempt to dissolve the ruling power of that male-centered order, to overturn the norms by which society governs itself.",

It unfolds through a dual narrative structure: one strand looks back at the protagonist's adolescence — helping her parents run a night market stall, shouldering the household after her mother's departure, drifting from place to place under the weight of debt; the other traces her adult years of failed job searches, a period spent on the margins of the sex industry, and an uncertain return to the family business. Through the repeated act of writing into memory torn apart by circumstance, the protagonist gradually reconstructs a sense of self — caught between flight from family and the solitude of creative work.Written in a cold, unflinching register, the novel lays bare the emotional wounds inflicted by family, while fixing its gaze on the struggle for survival among ordinary individuals during a period of profound social transformation in Taiwan — extending Chen Xue's characteristic concern for those living at society's edges.",

Small flickers of joy; suffering without horizon or end. Life, in her telling, is the exchange of immense pain for pleasures barely worth the name.

For a long stretch of time, Lin Bai's fiction was effectively synonymous in China with the idea of female subjectivity. Her most celebrated novel, A Private War (Yi Ge Ren De Zhanzheng), prompted the eminent scholar David Der-wei Wang to observe that Lin Bai had given voice, in that novel, to the private war belonging to women — a war fought alone, shared by countless women of her generation. The focus of this essay is her 1993 novel The Chair in the Corridor.",
